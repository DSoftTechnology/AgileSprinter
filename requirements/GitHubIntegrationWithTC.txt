TeamCity Integration w/ GitHub

How it works:
1. Create a branch of master repo
2. Make changes to code
3. Create a Pull Request
4. TeamCity detects the request, builds and runs tests
5. TeamCity clears or denies the request for merge
6. Merge the code back into the master repo

Integrating TeamCity only requires configuring the Branch Spec under VCS root. Instructions in link below:
