Existing stuff to keep

Userstories
	- Form is pretty good
	- Do something usefull with priority
	- should we allow to span sprints (TBD)
	- Assign to Task Lead (responsible for the summary) ??
	- Should userstory capture more details ?? (design / requirements block) ??
	- Show quick summary of tasks (title / hours) ??
	- add dependencies (wihtin project)
	- tag (enh / bug / ??)
	- max hours / LOE
	- keep track how many times it has been moved over (Keep reference to previous ?)

Tasks
	- Form is pretty good
	- Autogrow notes field
	- spellcheck on notes
	- Notes will be split up in blocks, each with their timestamp. Allow edit of previous notes, including the date.
	- How to summarize notes into usefull block for status reports??? Require summary when close userstory??


- If a tasks roadblocks the entire userstory, it should be visible for all tasks.
	- Add dependencies (only within userstory)

TaskHistory
	- Task History needs to be tied to a user in case task gets reassigned

Milestone
	- Project / Title / due date / start date / Risks (text / required) / Notes (text)
	- checkbox list of deliverables
	- will contain userstories
	- assign to TL

Project
	- add category (comm / fed / state / local)

Sprints
	- OK



Recurring functionality
	- simple flag or different types (e.g. meeting / phone call / IT stuff / general maintenance)
	- don't get automatically copied over.

Notifications

- Notity TL when all tasks are finished so he/she knows to close out (write summary


?? Even if userstory isn't finished, we still need a summary at the end of the sprint. How to resolve that???

!! Recycle bin instead of hard delete

SCREENS
-------
All
	- color code userstory without tasks, tasks that are unassigned - separate screen? toast notification? who sees it?

My sprint
	- show hours for each userstory
	- visually organize per project / userstory
 	- no more userstory color
	- drag & drop
	- filters:
		- project (def: all)
		- userstory (def: all)
		- priority (def: all)
		- sprint (default to current)
		- user (default to self)
	- keep hover
	- set remaining to zero for completed / obe / next sprint
	- keep burndown / hours

Project sprint 
	- merge with my sprint

Sprint overview
	- good as is

Milestone overview
	- TBD

Sprint planning
	- group by milestone (show & order by due dates)
	- product backlog -> show all, different background color for current sprint
		- filter by: anything userstory / project field
		- show start /end dates for sprints

Milestone planning
	TBD - new screen

Resource planning
	TBD - new screen
	
Sprint OVerview
	- Same tabular view as on my/project sprint (row per project)
	- Be able to see userstory tasks (as popup / inline details) (just summary: status / title / assigned to)
	- Close button instead of close column (no consensus - TBD)
	- filter by project

Metrics
	- Leave as is
	- Other metrics needed ?
	
Status Reports
	- Add free time range in addtion to the sprint range
	- correlate time range to the notes time field
	- Somehow incorporate the userstory summary on this page / let user pick what to show ?
	- Customize report format (ActiveReports / Devexpress / Telerik?)

Different types of users
	- Be able to grant read access to clients (which screens / data should they see / permission levels / groups)

Nice to have
	- autorefresh (interval?)
